# Squad Mortar Calc

A simple html/javascript form that calculates how a mortar should be configured for a given mortar and target position.

Made for the [PC game, Squad](http://joinsquad.com/)

# About the calculator

* Some calculations might seem weird due to the map coordinate system beeing upside down (positive Y points down/south).
* It's meant to be simple and quick way to get the mortar configuration, but I might refactor and/or make the input more user friendly ... some day.
